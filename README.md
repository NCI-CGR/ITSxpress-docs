# ITSxpress-docs

In order to run this workflow, refer to the instructions here: https://forum.qiime2.org/t/q2-itsxpress-a-tutorial-on-a-qiime-2-plugin-to-trim-its-sequences/5780

I was able to run the workflow using v1.8 q2-itsxpress plugin instead of v2.0 which had some installation issues.

Activate the qiime2 conda environment using: conda activate qiime2

Replace qiime itsxpress with qiime q2-itsxpress while running the commands
